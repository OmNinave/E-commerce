   - Need to be free? → Option A

3. **Time**
   - Need it in 1 week? → Option A
   - Can wait 3-4 weeks? → Option B
   - Want the best? → Option C

4. **Features**
   - Need order tracking? → Requires PostgreSQL
   - Need discount system? → Requires PostgreSQL
   - Need admin features? → Requires PostgreSQL
   - Need basic store? → Option A might work
