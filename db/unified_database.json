      "overview": "Since the 18th century, titration has been recognized as a cornerstone analytical method, originally requiring careful manual handling and strict operator expertise. With the advancement of automation, titration systems have evolved into highly sophisticated instruments capable of executing multi-parameter, multi-step titrations with unparalleled accuracy. The Titrator 1 – Model AT-TIT-712 takes this evolution further by fusing classical methodology with forward-looking digital automation. Its design significantly reduces manual input, minimizes human error, and enhances laboratory throughput while maintaining uncompromising accuracy and repeatability. By doing so, it not only preserves the integrity of traditional titration principles but also builds upon them with smart technology, flexible programming, and powerful analytical integration.",
