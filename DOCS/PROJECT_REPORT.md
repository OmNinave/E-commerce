## CHAPTER - 2: CASE STUDY

### 2.1 Introduction:

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, e-commerce has become an essential channel for businesses to reach customers and generate revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift dramatically, with online shopping becoming not just a convenience but a necessity for millions of consumers worldwide. Traditional brick-and-mortar businesses quickly realized the importance of having a robust online presence to survive and thrive in this new reality.

However, building a professional e-commerce platform that is secure, scalable, and user-friendly presents significant technical challenges. Such a platform must handle multiple complex requirements simultaneously: managing thousands of products, processing secure payments, tracking inventory in real-time, managing user authentication, handling concurrent user sessions, generating analytics, and providing seamless user experiences across different devices.

Many small and medium businesses struggle to find affordable yet comprehensive e-commerce solutions that meet their specific needs. Existing platforms either come with high subscription costs, limited customization options, vendor lock-in, or require extensive technical knowledge to set up and maintain. Additionally, security concerns around customer data protection, payment processing, and fraud prevention remain major obstacles for businesses venturing into online retail.

The main objective of this internship project was to design, develop, and deploy a complete, production-ready e-commerce platform that addresses these challenges. The platform needed to provide end-to-end functionality covering customer-facing features like product browsing, cart management, checkout process, and order tracking, as well as administrative features like product management, order fulfillment, inventory control, user management, and comprehensive analytics.

By leveraging modern web technologies such as React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and SQLite for the database, this project demonstrates how a professional e-commerce solution can be built efficiently while maintaining high standards of security, performance, and user experience. The platform incorporates industry best practices including JWT authentication, password encryption, API rate limiting, responsive design, real-time updates, and comprehensive error handling.

This case study will detail the complete development lifecycle of the e-commerce platform, from problem identification and requirement analysis through system design, implementation, testing, and deployment, showcasing the technical skills and knowledge gained during the internship period.

Product: Wireless Headphones
Base Price: ₹2,999
Selling Price: ₹2,499
Discount: 10% percentage

Calculation:
Final Price = 2,499 × (1 - 10/100)
Final Price = 2,499 × 0.9
Final Price = ₹2,249.10
```

**Step 4: Line Total Calculation**
```
For each cart item:
  line_total = final_price × quantity
```

**Example:**
```
Product: Wireless Headphones
Final Price: ₹2,249.10
Quantity: 2

Line Total = 2,249.10 × 2 = ₹4,498.20
```

**Step 5: Subtotal Calculation**
```
subtotal = sum of all line_totals
```

**Step 6: Shipping Cost Calculation**
```javascript
function calculateShippingCost(method, subtotal) {
  if (method === 'standard') {
    threshold = ₹50,000
    cost = ₹499
  } else if (method === 'express') {
    threshold = ₹1,00,000
    cost = ₹999
  }
  
  if (subtotal >= threshold) {
    return 0  // Free shipping
  } else {
    return cost
  }
}
```

**Example:**
```
Subtotal: ₹4,498.20
Shipping Method: Standard
Threshold: ₹50,000

Since 4,498.20 < 50,000:
Shipping Cost = ₹499
```

**Step 7: Final Total Calculation**
```
total_amount = subtotal + shipping_cost - loyalty_discount
```

**Complete Example:**
```
Item 1: Wireless Headphones
  Base: ₹2,499, Discount: 10%
  Final: ₹2,249.10 × 2 = ₹4,498.20

Item 2: Phone Case
  Base: ₹599, Discount: None
  Final: ₹599 × 1 = ₹599.00

Subtotal: ₹5,097.20
Shipping (Standard): ₹499
Loyalty Discount: ₹0

Total Amount: ₹5,596.20
```

#### 2.6.2 Stock Management Calculations

**Stock Availability Check:**
```javascript
function validateStock(product_id, requested_quantity) {
  available_stock = product.stock_quantity
  
  if (available_stock <= 0) {
    return ERROR: "Out of stock"
  }
  
  if (requested_quantity > available_stock) {
    return ERROR: "Only {available_stock} units available"
  }
  
  if (requested_quantity > MAX_QUANTITY) {
    return WARNING: "Maximum 25 units per order"
  }
  
  safe_quantity = min(requested_quantity, available_stock, 25)
  return safe_quantity
}
```

**Stock Update After Order:**
```javascript
function updateStock(order_items) {
  For each item in order:
    current_stock = SELECT stock_quantity 
                    FROM products 
                    WHERE id = item.product_id
    
    new_stock = current_stock - item.quantity
    
    UPDATE products 
    SET stock_quantity = new_stock,
        current_quantity = new_stock
    WHERE id = item.product_id
}
```

**Example:**
```
Before Order:
Product: Laptop
Stock Quantity: 15

Order Placed:
Quantity Ordered: 2

After Order:
New Stock = 15 - 2 = 13
Updated Stock Quantity: 13
```

#### 2.6.3 Analytics Calculations

**Total Revenue Calculation:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered')
  AND DATE(created_at) BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
```

**Average Order Value:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered')
```

**Top Selling Products:**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold,
  SUM(oi.line_total) as revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE o.status IN ('confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered')
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Revenue by Date Range:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as order_date,
  COUNT(*) as order_count,
  SUM(total_amount) as daily_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY order_date DESC
```

**Order Status Distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders)) as percentage
FROM orders
GROUP BY status
```

**Example Output:**
```
Status          Count   Percentage
pending         25      20.0%
confirmed       40      32.0%
shipped         30      24.0%
delivered       25      20.0%
cancelled       5       4.0%
```

#### 2.6.4 Discount Effectiveness Calculation

**Percentage Discount:**
```
Original Price: ₹1,000
Discount: 20%
Discount Amount = 1,000 × (20/100) = ₹200
Final Price = 1,000 - 200 = ₹800
Savings = ₹200
```

**Fixed Amount Discount:**
```
Original Price: ₹1,000
Discount: ₹150 flat
Discount Amount = ₹150
Final Price = 1,000 - 150 = ₹850
Savings = ₹150
```

#### 2.6.5 Pagination Calculations

```javascript
page = 2
limit = 12

offset = (page - 1) × limit
offset = (2 - 1) × 12 = 12

total_products = 145

total_pages = CEIL(total_products / limit)
total_pages = CEIL(145 / 12) = 13 pages

SQL QUERY:
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 12 OFFSET 12
(Returns products 13-24)
```

#### 2.6.6 Inventory Value Calculation

```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(selling_price × stock_quantity) as total_inventory_value,
  SUM(CASE WHEN stock_quantity < 10 THEN selling_price × stock_quantity ELSE 0 END) as low_stock_value
FROM products
WHERE is_active = 1
```

All calculations are performed server-side to prevent client-side manipulation, ensuring data integrity and security throughout the e-commerce operations.
