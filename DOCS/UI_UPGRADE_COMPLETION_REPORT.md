## 🎨 DESIGN CONSISTENCY CHECK

- **Glassmorphism**: Applied to all forms and modals (`bg-white/80 backdrop-blur`).
- **Animations**: `framer-motion` used for all page entries and list items.
- **Typography**: `text-gray-900` for headings, `text-gray-500` for body.
- **Interactions**: `hover-lift` and `btn-ripple` applied to interactive elements.
- **Layouts**: Responsive grids used everywhere (stack on mobile, split on desktop).

## 🧪 FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION

I have preserved all original logic while upgrading the UI:
- **Cart**: Calculations, remove, update quantity logic preserved.
- **Orders**: Fetching, cancelling, and viewing details logic preserved.
- **Addresses**: Add, edit, delete, set default logic preserved.
- **Auth**: API calls and error handling preserved.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1.  **Run the App**: `npm start`
2.  **Verify**: Click through the pages to see the animations in action.
3.  **Enjoy**: Your application now has a top-tier, professional UI.

**The UI is now fully polished and ready for presentation.**
