## 1.2 Historical Background:

Ativeer Solutions Private Limited, formerly known as Ativeer Tech, has evolved from a trading business to a registered manufacturing enterprise focused on laboratory analytical instruments.

### Early Phase as Ativeer Tech

The organization's roots trace back to Ativeer Tech, which operated as a trading and distribution business in the laboratory equipment sector in Kanpur, supplying laboratory equipment to research institutions, educational laboratories, and pharmaceutical companies across Uttar Pradesh.

Through direct customer interaction, the founders identified key market challenges: high dependence on imported instruments leading to elevated costs, limited after-sales support, price barriers for smaller laboratories, and lack of customization options. These insights led to the strategic decision to transition from trading to manufacturing, supporting India's "Make in India" initiative.

### Formal Incorporation as Ativeer Solutions Private Limited

On 15th February 2025, the business was formally incorporated as Ativeer Solutions Private Limited (CIN: U26516UP2025PTC216728) with the Registrar of Companies, Kanpur, with authorized capital of ₹10,00,000 and paid-up capital of ₹1,00,000. Directors Paras Jain and Ritu Jain lead the company's primary activity of manufacturing laboratory analytical instruments and apparatus.

The incorporation enabled establishment of manufacturing facilities, investment in precision equipment, hiring technical personnel, and pursuing quality certifications.

### Industry Growth and Digital Strategy

The Indian analytical instruments market is valued at approximately USD 1.71-3.77 billion in 2024, projected to reach USD 2.84-10.70 billion by 2033-2034, with annual growth rates between 5.80% to 11%. Growth drivers include expanding pharmaceutical industries, stringent quality control regulations, environmental testing requirements, and government support through "Make in India" and PLI schemes.

Ativeer Solutions has embraced digital transformation from inception, implementing e-commerce platforms, inventory management, and customer relationship management tools. The comprehensive e-commerce platform developed during this internship represents a key component of the company's digital strategy, enabling nationwide customer reach and providing transparent product information, online ordering, and tracking capabilities.
