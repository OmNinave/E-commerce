## ABSTRACT

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive e-commerce platform for Ativeer Solutions Private Limited, a laboratory instruments manufacturing company in Kanpur. As manufacturing businesses increasingly shift towards digital operations, traditional offline sales methods are becoming insufficient to reach wider markets and meet modern customer expectations. The challenge lies in creating a robust online platform that can efficiently manage product catalogs, process orders securely, handle payments, and provide seamless customer experience while integrating with existing manufacturing and inventory systems.

To address this challenge, the project implements a full-stack web application using modern technologies including React 18 for frontend, Node.js and Express for backend services, and SQLite for database management. The system features comprehensive product catalog management, secure user authentication using JWT tokens and bcrypt encryption, intelligent shopping cart functionality, multi-step checkout process, order tracking, and a feature-rich administrative dashboard for business operations.

The platform automatically handles critical e-commerce functions such as user registration and authentication, product browsing with search and filtering capabilities, real-time cart updates, secure payment processing through Razorpay integration, and automated email notifications. The system incorporates industry-standard security measures including CORS protection, Helmet security headers, rate limiting, input validation, and SQL injection prevention to ensure data safety and transaction security.

The administrative dashboard provides comprehensive tools for managing products, processing orders, tracking inventory, analyzing sales data, and managing customer relationships. Compared to traditional offline sales methods or basic online catalogs, this approach offers real-time inventory synchronization, automated order processing, scalable architecture, and data-driven business insights.

The implementation demonstrates successful integration of modern web technologies to create a production-ready e-commerce solution that enables Ativeer Solutions to establish a strong digital presence, reach customers nationwide, streamline business operations, and compete effectively in the digital marketplace. The platform addresses the critical need for digital transformation in the manufacturing sector, particularly for companies transitioning from traditional business models to modern e-commerce operations.
